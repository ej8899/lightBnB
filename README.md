# LightBnB

LightBnB is an "AirBnB" type clone for <a href="www.lighthouselabs.ca">LightHouseLabs.ca</a> students to work on SQL interactions via Ajax on a client-server application build. 

LightBnB clones the very, very basic function of AirBnB where we have a pre-build database of property listings across Canada on the 'backend' of the project, and our web application front end allows for searching of these properties only.  No user accounts, reservation scheduling, etc., is implemented but could be relatively easily.

## Quick Start...

## Detailed Operation...  
- Clone the github repository to your computer, and follow the instructions above in Quick Start to get to where you can run Tweeter on your computer. 

- From the main window, you can experiment with a few built in sample tweets, or start creating your own by clicking the double down chevrons in the top right to open the tweet message form.  We've incorporated extra features such as "like", "retweet" and "report" this tweet, along with tweet generators from the ICanHazDadJoke API and just a few random ones in our built in database.

- Clicking the smiley face icon gets you a "Dad Joke", while the shuffle arrows pull a random quote from our internal database.  The numbers represent the characters remaining in your tweet message.

- A tweet must be less than 140 characters, and of course, greater than zero characters!

- If "liking" tweets, you can quickly view your favorites, by clicking the heart icon under your avatar image.  Click it again to return to the view of all tweets.

- We've determined that 10 tweets loaded at a time is plenty.  So if you've got more, scroll down and click the "more" link.  A badge icon shows you how many more older tweets remain to be viewed.

- Tweeter is also built to support both 'desktop' and 'mobile' devices.  Down scaling your window will cause Tweeter to adjust for a more suitable display.

- Of course, we can't forget about everyone's favorite 'must-have' feature - dark mode! Just click the switch to toggle.  
Bonus: favorite state is preserved in localStorage.
